      This talk is about writing songs and playing music with python.
      Back in 2017 I came to know FoxDot, a python wrapper around SuperCollider,
      which is a super popular open source synthesizer. Since then, I have been using
      it to create entertaining lighting talks and would like to cover a bit more than
      just a lightning talk this time.

      with focus on cryptography and information security.He currently works at Red Hat
      as a Software Engineer in the Open Stack Security focus group.
