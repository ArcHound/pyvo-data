      Writing reliable software is one of the greatest challenges in software engineering.
      While it seems like there will be no silver bullet, there’s this nice idea stolen from information theory,
      implemented in some languages natively and available for many as an extension/library;
      Invariants that hold always true, no matter what. We’ll look first at the general idea behind contracts,
      and then a specific implementation, consider performance impacts, and how to deal with those.

    speakers:
      - Edvard Majakari
