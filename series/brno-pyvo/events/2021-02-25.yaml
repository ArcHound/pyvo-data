      You may know Google for search, YouTube, Android, Chrome, and Gmail, but that's only as an end-user of OUR apps.
      You can also integrate Google technologies into YOUR apps (web and mobile)! Did you know Google has many APIs
      and open source libraries that help you do that? If you have tried and found it challenging, not enough examples,
      run into roadblocks, got confused, or just curious about what Google APIs can offer, join us for the answers to your questions.
      Attendees will see demo code using multiple Google APIs with Python time-permitting, we will also try to give live demos.
