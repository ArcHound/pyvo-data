        Microservices architecture requires a high complexity of communication.
        To solve all the serialization, deserialization and validation without duplicated code,
        outdated documentation and untyped dicts is often challenging. Let’s look how we did it in a nice way.

        Michal is senior backend developer at Kiwi.com in the ancillaries team focusing on the baggage domain.
        He joined Kiwi.com in 2018 and has played a key role in building the baggage data flow and establishing a baggage platform.
